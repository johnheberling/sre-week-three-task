Recommendations
1. Install Jira and integrate it with Promethius.
2. Reconfigure the alerts for EndpointRegistrationTransientFailure to ignore, since they are transient, unless there are 6 within an hour.  Create a ticket for the high rate at most once per week.
3. Create tickets for EndpointRegistrationFailure, LLMBatchProcessingJobFailures, LLMModelStale, LLMModelVeryStale, or any combination of these.
4. Ignore TooFewEndpointsRegistered since it results from an EndpointRegistrationFailure.
